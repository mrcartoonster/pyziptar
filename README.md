#Pyziptar
> Magically unzip/decompress or zip/compress files with the power of Python and typer!


Here's a small little app that's powered by Python that will unzip files and tarballs for you in a simple command. No more trying to figure out what to do with tarballs. Also, if said tarballs give you trouble, `pyziptar` will diagnose and still make it work!
